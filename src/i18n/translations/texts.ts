export const textAbout = `I am a lover of acquiring knowledge and I have been looking in web development studies
    for a way to change the world, even if in a simple way. I believe that technology is an
    efficient means of transforming society into a better place. I am an ex-military member
    of the Brazilian Navy where I served for 9 years and acquired a lot of knowledge in several
    areas. I am studying the last semester of Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade das
    Am√©ricas (FAM) and I completed the Fullstack Web Development course at TRYBE. I focus on
    working in the areas of fullstack web development and intend to study more content focused
    on mobile development. I think about finishing my college and soon after continuing my
    training with certifications and postgraduate studies in the area of Software Engineering.
    I have experience in javascript with ReactJS and VueJS frameworks. My backend stacks are
    NodeJs with Express and C# (AspNetCore | .NET). I'm studying Java with Spring Boot to
    increase my range of backend stacks.`
