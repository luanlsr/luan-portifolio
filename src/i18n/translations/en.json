    "textAbout": "I am a lover of acquiring knowledge and I have been looking in web development studies for a way to change the world, even if in a simple way. I believe that technology is an efficient means of transforming society into a better place. I am an ex-military member of the Brazilian Navy where I served for 9 years and acquired a lot of knowledge in several areas. I am studying the last semester of Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade das AmÃ©ricas (FAM) and I completed the Fullstack Web Development course at TRYBE. I focus on working in the areas of fullstack web development and intend to study more content focused on mobile development. I think about finishing my college and soon after continuing my training with certifications and postgraduate studies in the area of Software Engineering. I have experience in javascript with ReactJS and VueJS frameworks. My backend stacks are NodeJs with Express and C# (AspNetCore | .NET). I'm studying Java with Spring Boot to increase my range of backend stacks.",
