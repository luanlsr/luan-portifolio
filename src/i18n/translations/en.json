I believe that technology is an efficient means of transforming society into a better place. I am a former soldier of the Brazilian Navy where I served for 9 years and acquired a lot of knowledge in several areas. I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade das AmÃ©ricas (FAM) and Fullstack Software Development at TRYBE. I focus on working in the areas of fullstack web development and I intend to study more content focused on mobile development. I'm thinking of finishing college and then continuing my training with certifications and postgraduate studies in Software Engineering. I have experience in javascript with ReactJS and VueJS frameworks. My backend stacks are NodeJs with Express and C# (AspNetCore | .NET).",
